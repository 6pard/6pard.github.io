<!-- I'm excited by a question: is there some similiarity between artificial neural networks and biological neurons?  -->
My research interests encompass healthcare machine learning systems and general artificial intelligence🧠🤖. I envision creating a learning system as efficient and effective as, or surpassing, human capabilities. During my PhD, I conducted extensive research on radiologists' eye-tracking, believing that incorporating the information found in a human expert's reasoning process is crucial for training neural networks.

I am also fascinated by neuroscience, computer graphics, hardware circuit design, and internal combustion engines, I have yet to become an expert in these fields😢.

I am curretnly a postdoc research at University of Pennsylvania, working with [Prof. Zhi Huang](https://www.zhihuang.ai). I got my PhD from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by [Prof. Dinggang Shen](http://idea.bme.shanghaitech.edu.cn) and [Prof. Qian Wang](https://qianwang.space). 
In my free time, I enjoy programming⌨️ (currently ![Github stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/jamesqfreeman?style=social) stars🌟), table tennis🏓, running🏃, swimming🏊, weightlifting🏋️, motorsports🏁 and cooking🍳.
