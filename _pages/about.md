My research interests encompass healthcare machine learning systems and general artificial intelligenceüß†ü§ñ. I envision creating a learning system as efficient and effective as, or surpassing, human capabilities. During my PhD, I conducted extensive research on radiologists' eye-tracking, believing that incorporating the information found in a human expert's reasoning process is crucial for training neural networks.

I am also fascinated by neuroscience, computer graphics, hardware circuit design, and internal combustion engines, I have yet to become an expert in these fieldsüò¢.

I am curretnly a PhD candidate at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by [Prof. Dinggang Shen](http://idea.bme.shanghaitech.edu.cn) and [Prof. Qian Wang](https://qianwang.space). 
Prior to this, I completed my BS degree from Northeastern University (Shenyang, China) and Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology) in 2015. In my free time, I enjoy programming‚å®Ô∏è (currently ![Github stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/jamesqfreeman?style=social) starsüåü), runningüèÉ, swimmingüèä, weightliftingüèãÔ∏è, and motorsportsüèÅ.


CAD with Eye-tracking
======
Our motivation is straightforward: leveraging the eye movements of radiologists to improve computer-aided diagnosis. The collection of this data is a passive and unobtrusive process that captures informative supervision related to the radiologists' diagnostic procedures. First, let me show some cases we collected, This red circle will not show up in the normal collecting, just here for demo.

    <p>1. To make sure the collected gaze are informative, we first use it as a network supervision during training. It is a pilot study that use gaze to improve deep-learning-based CAD sytem and is published at IEEE Trans on Medical Imaging at 2022. </p>

    <p>3. We extent gaze in the very foundamental part in computer vision, data augmentation. Our brains naturally and constantly augment images (e.g., by slightly shifting our gaze to view the same object from different angles). In our research, we investigated how we could improve current image augmentation techniques by mimicking the way humans use gaze.

    <p>4. We propose the idea of training a neural network solely on gaze information, as we believe gaze provides valuable insights for diagnostic tasks.

This work is submitted to ICCV 2023.</p>

Efficient Healthcare Machine Learning System
======
Although with recent progress, neural networks have on par ability compared to human in natural image. Currently, medical expert are more efficient at abstracting things (or say better representation ability). 
My guess is these medical analysis is a harder problem just like GPTs can not deal with mathmatical problem and coding test very well. 

I do think we are at the second research golden age for AI with LARGE transformers and webscale unsupervised pretraining. The first golden age are lead by ImageNet supervised pretrain and CNNs. As a
