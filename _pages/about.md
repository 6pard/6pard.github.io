<!-- I'm excited by a question: is there some similiarity between artificial neural networks and biological neurons?  -->
My research interests encompass healthcare machine learning systems and general artificial intelligence🧠🤖. I envision creating a learning system as efficient and effective as, or surpassing, human capabilities. During my PhD, I conducted extensive research on radiologists' eye-tracking, believing that incorporating the information found in a human expert's reasoning process is crucial for training neural networks.

I am also fascinated by neuroscience, computer graphics, hardware circuit design, and internal combustion engines, I have yet to become an expert in these fields😢.

I am curretnly a PhD candidate at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by [Prof. Dinggang Shen](http://idea.bme.shanghaitech.edu.cn) and [Prof. Qian Wang](https://qianwang.space). 
Prior to this, I completed my BS degree from Northeastern University (Shenyang, China) and Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology) in 2015. In my free time, I enjoy programming⌨️ (currently ![Github stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/jamesqfreeman?style=social) stars🌟), running🏃, swimming🏊, weightlifting🏋️, motorsports🏁 and cooking🍳.
