Education
======
* B.S. in BME, Northeastern University & Chinese Academy of Science, Shenyang, **gpa 3.90 and rank 1/116**, 2015-2019
* Ph.D in EE, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, **National PhD Scholarship (top 2%)**, 2019-present

Experience
======
* 2023: Team Leader for Large Foundation Model Research
  * ShanghaiTech University, IDEA Lab.
  * We published the **first** LLM&CAD study ChatCAD at 2023/2/14. We merged the strengths of LLMs' medical domain knowledge and logical reasoning with the vision understanding capability of existing medical-image CAD models to create a more user-friendly and understandable system for patients compared to conventional CAD systems.
  * We published the **first** Chinese medical LLM DoctorGLM at 2023/4/3. Try via [this site](https://doctorglm.idealab-llms.com). Our main focus was on exploring various methods of alignment (SFT/RLHF/RRHF) and different techniques for organizing training data.

* 2019-2022: Researcher for Radiologist's Eye Gaze in Computer-aided diagnosis
  * Shanghai Jiao Tong University & ShanghaiTech University
  * After watching a Twitch streamer use eye trackers in their game, I realized the potential of eye movements as a source of valuable information. This inspired me to explore the use of eye tracking technology among radiologists to enhance computer-aided diagnosis. You can find further details on this topic at the [following cite](https://jamesqfreeman.github.io/eyetracking/).
  * I helped to build the eye-tracking lab of ShanghaiTech University's BME department. 
  * I have completed four papers, with three of them being first-authored. Two have been accepted by the top journal TMI, one is currently under review at ICCV23, and another is under review at TNNLS.
