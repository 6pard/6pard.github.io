New age with Foundation Models
======
I believe we are currently experiencing the second golden age of AI research, driven by the emergence of LARGE transformers and webscale unsupervised pretraining. The first golden age was led by ImageNet supervised pretraining and CNNs. In light of this, I am motivated to work on projects that have the potential to become the cornerstone of this exciting new era in AI research.

1. We propose ChatCAD, that use trained CAD networks and use ChatGPT (or other LLMs) to merge them. To make the result more truthy, we are adding a healthcare retriever into this framework (like New Bing)

2. We are also working on MeLo, a medical image low-rank adaptation scheme that is to replace finetuning in medical image analysis. This is a work I really enjoy doing as a programmer and engineer. More information coming soon.
