    <b style="color: #4a4a83;">GeneraVid: Diffusion-based Short Video Generation</b>
    <br>
    <p>
      This project focuses on building a lightweight video generation system based on diffusion models. 
      It supports controllable video synthesis under constraints such as text prompts and scene structures. 
      I was mainly responsible for designing the data preprocessing pipeline, fine-tuning the diffusion backbone,
      and implementing the Flask-based API for serving the model in a user-friendly interface.

    <b style="color: #4a4a83;">CloudPoint: Robust Point Cloud Recognition</b>
    <br>
    <p>
      A research-driven project aiming to improve point cloud classification under noisy and incomplete data.
      The work integrated transformer-based attention modules into a 3D backbone network.
      My role was to lead the algorithm design, conduct experiments on ShapeNet and ModelNet benchmarks,
      and optimize inference performance for deployment in robotics.

  <div>
    <b style="color: #4a4a83;">Noise-Resistant DOA Estimation</b>
    <br>
    <p>
      An applied signal processing project that built a direction-of-arrival estimation algorithm for
      sound localization in noisy environments. 
      I implemented the algorithmic core in Python using NumPy and SciPy, 
      validated robustness with real-world microphone array recordings, 
      and co-led the documentation and results analysis.
